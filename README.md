# Covid_19

Basic Analysis of Covid 19 Italy data in order to draw conclusion to governing authority to provide an overview of the Previous to Current Scenarion on Various aspects of the Pandamic disease.

Statement-Relational plot for  Total Cases-Recovered
Conclusion- Recovery rate increased almost exponentially after Total cases extend 10K, the disease effect reduction and improve in all-over health care.

Statement-Relational plot for  Total Cases-Death
Conclusion- Death rate was in uptend while cases below 10K, but took almost flat curve on increased cases. Increase in facility includes bed, ICU, oxygen denotes same(Refer to database), in each Health care unit, might keeps the numbers still.

NewPositive cases took little upward trend while Test rate between 2-2.5, indicate Variation in trend as Hospital data looks good as before, Month, season Analysis required for further details.

Intensive Care Unit admission increased but seemed vague with icreased number of cases at the same rate. Hospitals found to in a postion to handle more number of people for ICU admission.

Further Pairplot provided for complete analysis.

The report all over indicate that Hospital and Life Science Company might need a increase in database for as further data required for Detail in Future analysis. We recommend Hospitals to increase server strength for online approach for Patient admission before hand, this will help in critiacal situations when cases found increase (refer between 2-2.5 for Graph-NewPositive cases). We recommend the Hospital apllications to go under Performance Test as this can create load at critical moment, leading to failure in server. 

The report generation will provide clear idea about maximum load the application can withstand, with Volume Testing which will indicate the breakpoint of the application.
Average server hit will be recorded and simulations will be created with Virtual users by HP Performance Center, to measure the Statibility.

We as an enterprise ensure 3 rounds of Load test and Error diffrence will be calculated as Usual. 
Prefered Tool-Loadrunner(req. Licence)

Report Generation to be provided for further improvement or to denote bottleneck within application
Maintaince- upto 3 months, on any Update.
